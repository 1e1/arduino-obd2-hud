Here are the OBD2 Mode $01 and Mode $09 message IDs (PIDs) with the formulas to format the bits of the messages to the right value:

Mode $01:

    ** PID 0x0D: Vehicle Speed (km/h) **
    + Request message: 01 0D 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 41 0D XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Speed (km/h) = (XX * 256 + YY) / 256 (where XX and YY are the two byte values)
    ** PID 0x0C: Engine RPM (rev/min) **
    + Request message: 01 0C 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 41 0C XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: RPM = (XX * 256 + YY) / 4 (where XX and YY are the two byte values)
    ** PID 0x15: Fuel consumption (l/100km) **
    + Request message: 01 15 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 41 15 XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Fuel consumption (l/100km) = XX / 20 (where XX is the single byte value)
    ** PID 0x42: Handbrake status (on/off) **
    + Request message: 01 42 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 41 42 XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Handbrake status = XX & 0x01 (where XX is the single byte value, 0x01 for on, 0x00 for off)
    ** PID 0x31: Distance traveled (km) **
    + Request message: 01 31 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 41 31 XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Distance (km) = XX * 256 + YY (where XX and YY are the two byte values)

Mode $09:

    ** PID 0x09: Fuel level (percent) **
    + Request message: 09 09 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 49 09 XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Fuel level (%) = XX (where XX is the single byte value, 0-100)
    ** PID 0x0B: Gear position **
    + Request message: 09 0B 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 49 0B XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Gear position = XX (where XX is the single byte value, 0x00 = Reverse, 0x01 = Neutral, 0x02 = 1st, ..., 0x07 = 6th)
    ** PID 0x1F: Occupied seats **
    + Request message: 09 1F 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 49 1F XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Occupied seats = XX (where XX is the single byte value, 0-8)
    ** PID 0x20: Closed belts **
    + Request message: 09 20 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 49 20 XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Closed belts = XX (where XX is the single byte value, 0-8)
    ** PID 0x21: Day/night mode **
    + Request message: 09 21 00 00 00 00 00 00
    + Response message: 49 21 XX XX XX XX XX XX
    + Formula: Day/night mode = XX & 0x01 (where XX is the single byte value, 0x01 for night, 0x00 for day)

Note:

    The formulas assume that the response messages are in the format MODE PID XX XX XX XX XX XX, where XX represents the requested data value.
    The specific PID values, formulas, and formats may vary depending on the vehicle manufacturer and model.
    Not all vehicles may support all of these PIDs, so you may need to use a diagnostic tool or consult the vehicle's documentation to determine which PIDs are supported.
